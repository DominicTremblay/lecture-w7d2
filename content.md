## ORM

### Knex vs ActiveRecord

- What does knex help us do?
- What is it? Knex is a query builder or an SQL builder
- compare knex with Active Record
- problem with knex... joins on severable tables using the same column names. You would have to alias those or else they would be overwritten

dont't need to make attrib_accessor. Active Record will do that for us.
